# My framework

The repo name `del8` comes from [8 Del. C.](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/), which is the title of Delaware legal code pertaining to corporations.
This choice comes from naming another project using this framework after a Delaware corporate law section.
Like Title 8 is the framework within which that section resides, this is the framework within that project resides.


**Few thoughts:**
Code is written in a variety of contexts including production code, test code, and research code.
The properties of "good" code and "good" frameworks depends significantly on the context.
Since a company might depend on an engineer's code for billions of dollars of revenue years after they have quit,
maintainability is a major goal when writing production code.
Test code, on the other hand, must be written to be cleary correct from a glance as the test code itself has no tests.
Numerous frameworks and abstractions have sprung up to facilitate writing "good" production and test code.
