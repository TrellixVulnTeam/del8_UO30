# My framework

The repo name `del8` comes from [Title 8](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/) of Delaware state law, which is the part of  Delaware's legal code pertaining to corporations.
This choice comes from naming another project using this framework after a Delaware corporate law's statute number.
Like Title 8 is the framework within which that statute resides, this is the framework within that project resides.
