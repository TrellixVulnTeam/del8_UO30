# My framework

The repo name `del8` comes from [8 Del. C.](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/), which is the title of Delaware legal code pertaining to corporations.
This choice comes from naming another project using this framework after a Delaware corporate law section.
Like Title 8 is the framework within which that section resides, this is the framework within that project resides.
